IRin - USB device, what receive IR remote signals and send it via USB.
http://helius.github.com/IRin/

IRin used 'microrl' library (git://github.com/Helius/microrl.git) for command line interface, if you clone 'IRin' git repo, don't remember execute:
$git submodule init
$git submodule update

Device recognize by Linux as /dev/ttyUSB0 (or /dev/ttyACM0) see '/var/log/syslog'.

Just write simple script with `cat /dev/ttyUSB0` and read line by line IR code from dongle.
Now it's support command line interface for configuring (via /dev/ttyUSB0, just open it in mimicom). Your may set ascii name for key (VOLUME_UP for NEC_D419ACE0) via simple CLI shell.

$minicom -c on -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200

Device implements USB-CDC (communication device class) and no needs driver on Linux (Windows needs standard CDC driver, not included in all distrib)


Project contains:
* schematic (EAGLE)
* pcb (EAGLE) - trace at one layer, for home-made (laser printer + laminator)
* source code - base on Atmel USB frame-work
* some scripts for load firmware to device and use it.
