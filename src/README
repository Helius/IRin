usb-device-cdc-serial-project/  Atmel USB-CDC  based IRin source code

************ HOW IT WORKS ***********

Device get IR-receiver line change status in interrupt and handle it with routines in ir.c source, what returns IR-key codes.
Key codes send via usb-dcd driver to virtual com port as ascii strings.
If you open virtual com port with terminal (like minicom) you give simple command line interfase for configuring device (set name string for key code, change repeat-key delay, etc).

************** Change log ***********
Look at github.com for detail.
