IRin - USB device, what recieve IR remote signals and send it via USB. 

Just write simple script with `cat /dev/ttyACM0` and read line by line IR code from dongle.
Now it's support command line interface for configuring (via /dev/ttyACM0, just open it in mimicom)

Device implements USB-CDC (communication device class) and no needs driver on Linux (Windows needs standart CDC driver, not included in all distrib)

Project contains:
* schematic (EAGLE)
* pcb (EAGLE) - trace at one layer, for home-made (laser printer + laminator)
* source code - base on Atmel USB frame-work
* some scripts for load firmvare to device and use it.
